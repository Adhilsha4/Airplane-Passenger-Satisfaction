#Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

Introduction:

In today’s fast-paced world, there are several modes of transportation — Roadways, Railways, Waterways, and Airways. Among these, air travel stands out as the fastest and most premium option. However, it comes with strict protocols such as passport verification, visa approvals, ticketing, and boarding, which may cause discomfort or frustration to passengers.
Due to these procedures and rigid airline policies, passengers often prefer airlines that offer efficient and comfortable experiences.

Key Factors Affecting Passenger Satisfaction:
* Ticketing and Boarding Services
* Baggage Handling
* Seat Comfort and Legroom
* In-flight Wi-Fi
* Onboard Services
* Airport Facilities

To enhance services and understand customer expectations, airlines collect feedback from passengers. Analyzing this data enables them to improve service quality and passenger satisfaction.

Project Objective:

This project aims to predict whether a passenger is Satisfied or Dissatisfied with their flight experience using a Machine Learning model.

The Model Helps To:
* Identify the key factors that influence passenger satisfaction
* Predict satisfaction levels based on passenger survey responses
* Support airlines in making data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience

Machine Learning Workflow:

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Selection using Recursive Feature Elimination Method(RFE)
* Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* Evaluation using Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
* Deployment using Streamlit

Note:
  The trained model is hosted on Google Drive due to GitHub file size limits. It will be downloaded automatically when the app starts.
